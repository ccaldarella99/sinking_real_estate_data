Data Scientists:

Best looking projects from a Data standpoint:
	Car Calculator: Plenty of data for the Car Calculator, should be the easiest to implement - best data
	Real Estate with rising Sea Levels: This one is the next easiest. There are interactive maps, but this integration with real estate has NOT been done.


The others have issues here and there that would make it a bit more difficult
	Storm Alert: We would be adding to the National Weather Service (that already does this)
	Bee population: Hard to do b/c of lack of data
	Recycling:	 A lot of data, scattered and harder to work with. Need to figure out something more specific and doable.


Would there be a way to see how prices have been changing, and see if there is a correlation? 
Yes, probably, we can look at zillow for prices - not sure if there are historical prices.


Benjamin shared this article yesterday: https://www.millionacres.com/real-estate-investing/articles/where-rising-sea-levels-could-swamp-affordable-housing/

Possibly include how low-income housing is affected by this.

It was mentioned that there are many apps showing Flooding and rising sea levels and it was mentioned that Real estate has not yet been integrated with this.


Went over the difference of a mobile app and optimizing for mobile.
We will be Optimizing for mobile - we will not be making an app.


It looks like we will be doing Real Estate vs Rising Sea Levels!
We need to write up a synopsis for submittal.
Answer: [solve XX problem] for [end users]


Team Leads to meet up tomorrow (9/23/2021).


We will need to look for a template for Problem Statements to start us off.


What are the tools?
	Perhaps use Trello: it's easy to use and free
	Google Doc for Team to communicate what we are doing/needing.
	Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1umx7kzhESgH0cqJscHfP88lsexFsjHdn?usp=sharing



Team Leads meeting tomrrow at 1PM to work on Problem Statement, to be posted in slack, and Debbie to present to Ashley. Debbie will present on Friday.
